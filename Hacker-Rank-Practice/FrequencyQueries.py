# PROBLEM NOTES:
    # Query 1: inserting a number, x, into the list
    # Query 2: deleting 1 occurence of a number, y, from the list (if present)
    # Query 3: Check if any number is present whose frequency is exactly z (meaning check for a duplicate number), if yes print '1', if not, print '0'
    # Return an array of 0s and 1s


# HIGH LEVEL PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
    # Given a list of queries, where each query is in the form of x and y values. The number 1 in the x value represents insertion into your data structure, and the number 2 in the x value represents deletion, if a number is present, from the data structure. The number 3 in the x value checks if the number in the y axis matches the amount of times a number appears in the data structure. If it does appear the correct number of times in the data structure then return a '1' in the output list and if not, return a '0' in the output list. The goal is to return the output list of 0s and 1s.


# HIGH LEVEL SOLUTION:
    # â€‹Look through the queries list, checking if the x axis value for each query is a 1, 2, or 3. If it is 1, add the value in the 1st dictionary, and add the value for the given key in the 2nd dictionary. If it is 2, subtract the value in the 1st dictionary and subtract the value for the given key in the 2nd dictionary. If it is 3, check if the key of the 2nd dictionary is present and if the value is greater than 0, if it is, add 1 to the results list, otherwise add 0 to the results list. In the end return the results list.

# SOLUTION:
    # Step 1: Create a frequency dictionary to track the key value pairs of the frequencies of each number
    # Step 2: Create an empty list for storage, called results to be returned
    # Step 3: Create a second frequency dictionary to keep track of how many times each key of the 1st dictionary appears
    # Step 4: Loop through queries list
    # Step 5: Check if the x axis(1st index) in the query is set to 1, if it is, increment the value if it exists in the 1st dictionary (frequency), and increment the value for the given key in the 2nd dictionary (frequencyValues)
    # Step 6: Check if the x axis element in the query is set to 2, if it is, decrement the value, if it exists, in the 1st dictionary (frequency) setting to 0 so it can't go to a negative integer, and decrement the value for the given key in the 2nd dictionary (frequencyValues)
    # Step 7: Check if the x axis element in the query is set to 3, if it is, check if the key of the 2nd dictionary is present and if it is, check its value to see if it is greater than 0, if it is, add 1 to the results array, otherwise add 0 to the results array.
    # Step 8: Return the results array.
